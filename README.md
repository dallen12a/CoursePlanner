# CoursePlanner

Base level course planner created for CS300 at SNHU. This program displays a menu that allows a user to choose a numerical option. The user will be able to load a course data file from CSV format. They can then view the whole list of courses. They can also type in the specific course from the list to see its id, title, and any applicable prerequisites.
